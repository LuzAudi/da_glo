# Python Basics: Matrix Calculation
# Create a class which allows to represent a matrix of any order or shape (n x n, n x m). It should also allow the following operations with matrices:

# Matrices addition
# Scalar multiplication
# Matrices multiplication
# Matrix transpose
# Matrix determinant
# Adjugate matrix
# Inverted matrix
# Add additional methods:

# A method to obtain a matrix row. Do not return repeated rows. E.g., you can specify that the rows 1,3,8 are desired from a 20x10 matrix.

# A method to obtain a matrix column. Do not return repeated columns. E.g., you can specify that the columns 2,4,10 are desired from a 20x10 matrix.

# A method to obtain part of the matrix from a certain column. E.g., from a 10x10 matrix, the 10x2 matrix from column 5 is desired.

# A method to show the matrix on screen as a matrix.

# A 3x6 matrix can be defined at the class instantiation time like this: Matrix([[1,2,3,4,5,6], [10,11,12,13,14,15], [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6]])

# Do not use the numpy package for this implementation. Just use the Standard Library.
